## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Document Objective
This technical document describes the process of creating a PostgreSQL database for a car sales website. The database is intended to store information about cars, sales, customers, and other relevant data.

## 2 Requirements and Details

### 2.1 Database Requirements

The database must be able to store the following data:

- Car information, including make, model, year, mileage, color, VIN, and price
- Sales information, including sale ID, customer ID, car ID, sale date, and sale price
- Customer information, including name, address, phone number, and email address
- Maintenance and repair information, including service date, description of work, cost, and car ID
- Payment information, including payment ID, sale ID, payment date, payment amount, and payment method

### 2.2 Database Design

The database will be designed with the following tables:

- Cars: stores information about each car, including make, model, year, mileage, color, VIN, and price
- Sales: stores information about each sale, including sale ID, customer ID, car ID, sale date, and sale price
- Customers: stores information about each customer, including name, address, phone number, and email address
- Maintenance and Repairs: stores information about each maintenance and repair event, including service date, description of work, cost, and car ID
- Payments: stores information about each payment, including payment ID, sale ID, payment date, payment amount, and payment method

## 3 Scripting

The following scripts were used to create the database:

### 3.1 Script for Addresses

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS addresses(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
country VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
state VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
zip_code INT NOT NULL,

address_line2 VARCHAR(50)
);
```

This script creates a table called "addresses" with columns for storing address information, including country, state, zip code, address line 1, and address line 2. It also defines an auto-incrementing ID column as the primary key.

### 3.2 Script for creating Customers

```

address_id INT REFERENCES addresses(id),
user_status user_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
photo_url TEXT
);
```

### 3.3 Script for Super admins

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS super_admins(

## 4 Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Testing methodology

The database was tested by inserting sample data and verifying that it was stored correctly. The database was also tested by performing various queries to ensure that the data could be retrieved and processed correctly.

## 5 Deployment and Maintenance

### 5.1 Deployment
To deploy the database, the scripts were executed on a PostgreSQL server. The server was configured to allow remote access and backups were scheduled regularly to ensure data integrity. Maintenance of the database includes regularly optimizing and tuning the database for performance, and ensuring that backups are properly secured and stored. It is also important to regularly update the database software to ensure that security patches and bug fixes are applied.

## 6 Security Measures

### 6.1 Methodology

To ensure the security of the database, the following measures were implemented:

- Unique logins and passwords are required for all users who access the database.
- Passwords are required to be complex and changed regularly.
- All communication with the database is encrypted using SSL.
- Access to sensitive information is limited to authorized personnel only.
- The database is regularly backed up and stored in a secure off-site location.
- The database is regularly audited to ensure that there are no security vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.

## 7 Procedures and Usage

### 7.2 Listings

#### 7.2.1 Endpoints

- getAutoComplete: Aid the user by completing their string with system sugestion.
- getListings/search: Elastic Search returns the listngs by relevancy.
- getListingsById: Gives front end the information to proyect the DB information.

#### 7.2.2 Expected Results

It is expected that when the user inputs information on the search bar to see the following steps:

- The User starts typing and the Auto Complete brings out possible string.

- The user inputs their selection in the search bar.

- The system using Elastic Search returns the results ordered by relevance.

- The system proyects in the listing page the results.

### 7.3 User Registry

#### 7.3.1 Endpoints

- createUser (firebase): connects to firebase to upload the personal information of the new user.
- updateUser (firebase): connects to firebase to update the information of an existing user.

#### 7.3.2 Expexted Results

It is expected that when the user inputs information on the user creation view to see the following steps:

- The user inputs the correct information to the system.

- The system connects to Firebase DB to upload the information.

- If the request is an user creation and the information is valid, the user is created and its ID returned.

- If the request is an update and the information is valid, the user is updated.

### 7.4 Wishlists

#### 7.4.1 Endpoints

- getUserWishlist: Retrieve the user's related id.
- deleteCarFromWishlist: Deletes a value inside a user's Wishlist array.

#### 7.4.2 Expected Results

It is expected that when the user's wishlist to exist, to follow the hereunder flow:

- If the user creates adds a wishlist bring the carId to the wishlist. It remains there until deleted.

- If the user deletes an element of the wishlist, the carid is unrelated.

### 8.1 Database Architecture

![ArchitectureDB](arquitecturaDB.PNG)

The arquitecture of the DB can be described by the following flow:

```Script SQL -> Translation to JavaScript (ORM) -> Query in Lambda Function -> Return Info in JSON -> Information returns to Frontend```
