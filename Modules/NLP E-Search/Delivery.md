## Delivery

### Test document

- A testing document will be delivered, the tests performed will mainly be API tests.
- The endpoints that will be tested and documented will be the search and recommendation endpoints.

### API Docs

- The endpoints will also be documented with the help of an api docs generator like postman.
- These docs will include information about how to perform the requests, what headers, payload, arguments each endpoint needs.

### Search demo

- Show the characteristics of our search model, emphazising what is taken into account in order to extract the results.
- In the demo we will also provide the list of all the user stories completed with their respective validations.

### Infrastructure/architecture diagram and technical document

- A diagram that explains the different steps in the search flow.
- The diagram will also include the components involved in the process (azure, elastic, aws, etc).
- A technical document will also be delivered, in which the system/algorithms behind the search are explained. 
- The technical NLP document will have two sections: semantic search and NER.
- Each section will explain what is the responsability of each model (semantic search and NER) why we decided to use them and how they were implemented.

### Code

- All the code files, including the configuration and infrastructure code files will be provided.
