# TD-Test Drive Delivery

## Delivery
---
### Test Document
- Delivery of a document detailing the tests carried out.
- Each test will have a template to be filled in, where we can have a structure of the tests and identify how, when, and who did them.


### Front page views
- Simulation: 
 To show how the interfaces work, a simulation of interaction with the platform will be shown for both the user and salesman view.
- A video will be provided showing both views and the interaction between request-response between user and salesman.

- Test Drive views done with Next.js uploaded to the platform.



### User's Manual
- User manual:
A user flow is provided, which explains in detail how the client and salesman can use and navigate the test drive view's. This manual will be available for both users.
