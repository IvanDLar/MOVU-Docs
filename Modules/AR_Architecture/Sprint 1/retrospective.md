# Risks
- Terraform was complex for the team to learn and use, specially to deploy lambdas. The mitigation was to use serverless framework to deploy lambdas, and terraform to deploy the infrastructure.
- Spent too much time developing cli tools for the team to use. The mitigation was to use serverless framework to deploy lambdas, and dont develop features that were not needed like building the lambdas automatically.

# Things we can improve
- Improve CI/CD pipeline to deploy lambdas and infrastructure.
