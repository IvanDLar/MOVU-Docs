### HomeSearchBar

`HomeSearchBar.tsx` is a component that renders a search bar in the Home Page, allowing users to search for cars by make, model, or keyword. The search bar should include a search button and an input field with autocomplete functionality to assist users in their search process. Upon submitting a search, users will be redirected to the Search Cars page with the relevant search results.

The section can include an attractive background image, a heading, a short description, and a button that directs users to the test drive scheduling page.

## Key Functionality

The Home Page module is designed to provide a seamless user experience, offering quick access to the most important features and information. Key functionality includes the car search feature, navigation between different sections, and the ability to view and interact with car listings.

## API Integration

The Home Page module integrates with a car search API to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information about the available cars. The API integration allows for dynamic loading of car listings based on user search queries, as well as filtering options to refine the search results.

## Responsive Design

The Home Page module is built with responsive design principles to ensure a consistent and visually appealing experience across various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout and components adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a crucial consideration in the development of the Home Page module. All components are designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, ensuring that the website is usable by as many people as possible. This includes the use of proper semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support.
