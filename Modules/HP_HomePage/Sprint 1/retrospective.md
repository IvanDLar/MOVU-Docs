# Risks + mitigation

- Being stuck in the car search process because the NLP search module has not concluded: Maintain good communication with the NLP team to stay updated and progress according to the advancements made in the search.
- Having placed buttons and links to pages that will not be created: Review which pages are planned to be created and base the UI on that.

# Things we can improve
