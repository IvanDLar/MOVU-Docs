# Risks + mitigation

- Being stuck in the car search process because the NLP search module has not concluded: Maintain good communication with the NLP team to stay updated and progress according to the advancements made in the search.
- Having placed buttons and links to pages that will not be created: Review which pages are planned to be created and base the UI on that.
- Bad responsiveness for different screen sizes: Create clear breakpoints for the different screen sizes and test the UI in each of them.

# Things we can improve

- Better communication with the other teams

# Things we did good

- We have finished almost all the tasks in the module.
- The design accurately reflected the provided UI.
