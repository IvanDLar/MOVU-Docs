# Risks + mitigations

- This is a very big module and it touches a lot of other modules, this could provoke that we interfere with each others work: Have a sprint planning every monday to assign tasks, invite other module leaders to the meeting.
- There is a lot of poeple in the module and we canÂ´t all always attend the meetings: report status in chat and record the meetings.
- The data model does not align with the car dealership regitration request: create a separate table for the requests.
- Testing the endpoints is diffucult because we require accounts of different types to test them: create fake accounts with privilages to test the endpoints.

# Things we did good

- Despite starting the sprint on tuesday, we managed to complete a lot of tasks.
- Good coordination between backend and frontend functionalities.
- Quickly ideate how to implement new functionalities.

# Things we will do to improve next sprint

- Start the sprint sooner and organice task assignments better.
- Make sure that everyone understands their assigned task and knows who to go to for questions.
- Communicate bettwe with the database and auth teams to avoid missunderstandings.
