## Risks
- Lack of data in the database to test the correct functionality of the frontend: Have a good communication and coordination with database module.
- UI/UX design does not fit to the client: Have a acceptance test with the client to check the UI/UX design.
- Text Fields not sanitized in frontend permit SQL injection: Test every text field in every page to avoid SQL injection.
- Incorrect definition of user views: Have feedback meetings with project managers and other modules.

## Things we can improve
- Define priorities and order of the views to code.
- Check if the UX design is clear with all the views to code.
- Document of the development process (e.g., risks and stoppers).

## Things we did good
- Separate the development of the different views according to the preferences of the team.
- Meetings and message communication throughout the week.
- Making feedback of the UX design to make it more user friendly.
